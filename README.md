# Diabetes Prediction Analysis 🩺🔬🧪🧬

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Analysis repository! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, and uses machine learning models to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The project was carried out using Python and the Noteable platform.

## Project Overview 📝

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The Pima Indians Diabetes Database was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis, including data visualization, to understand the characteristics of the data and the relationships between different variables.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocessed the data to prepare it for machine learning models. This included splitting the data into training and test sets.

4. **Model Building**: We built a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model to predict whether a patient has diabetes.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluated the models' performance using accuracy as the metric.

6. **Model Improvement**: We tried several strategies to improve the models' performance, including using a more complex model, tuning the model's parameters, and engineering new features.

## Tools Required 🛠️

This project was developed using the following tools:

- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A Python library used for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: A Python library used for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: A Python library based on Matplotlib that is used for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library used for machine learning and data analysis.
- **Google Colab**: An online platform for running Python notebooks.

## How to Use 💻

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required tools and libraries. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python notebook platform.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, perform the analysis, build the models, and evaluate the models.

## Future Work 🚀

There are many other strategies we could try to further improve the model's performance, such as creating more interaction features, using a different model, or using a different method for parameter tuning. Contributions are welcome!
